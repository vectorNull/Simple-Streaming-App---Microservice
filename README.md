This is just the first service of a much larger project. I will be using modern tooling such as:
- Docker - to package and deploy
- Docker Compose - To test our services on workstation
- Kubernetes - to host our app in the cloud (Asure)
- Terraform - to build our cloud infrastructure

Node/Express will be the primary tech stack for this project.
